//with the help of let and const you can declare the variable in differnt memory space i.e
// in temporal dead zone
// let and const is hoisted in differnt memory space in scope section
//let and const never use before initialisation
// both follows block scope
// block is a piece of code where javascript expect single statement
// let value can be modified  once declared you can setup the values
// const value cant be modified once intialised at the time of declaration should be must

// console.log(a)       //-> reference error
// let a = 5
// a = "Amul Sharma"       //-> yes you can modified the let value 
// console.log(a)       //-> run
